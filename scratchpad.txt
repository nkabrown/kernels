what are my learning objectives?

build a strong knowledge base because it can enable future creativity
  '...we would argue that a strong knowledge base is a prerequisite to being
  creative in a particular domain. A student is unlikely to make creative
  discoveries in any subject without a comprehensive set of facts and concepts at
  his or her command. There is no necessary conflict in learning concepts and
  facts and in thinking creatively; the two are symbiotic.' Roediger & Pyc 2012
