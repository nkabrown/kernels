#all about variables and functions

##the world of variables

Most introductions to programming in a specific language begin with values and their associated types. This book does not and I believe it&rsquo;s because of it&rsquo;s language independent approach. We skip a discussion of values and immediately move to the world of variables.

What is a variable? Very succinctly it is a shortcut to a value and it saves programmers from having to remember and retype values.  But where do you begin to try to understand the ins & outs of variables? I&rsquo;m going to start with assignment because all three fundamental concepts that underlie the word 'variable' are involved in assignment. **Assignment through the environment binds an identifier to a variable in memory.** First, draw an invisible line to separate variables in memory from identifiers and environments. The variable in memory remains invisible to the programmer while the identifiers and environments become the programmer&rsquo;s tools to interact with the variables in the store.

Is using the container metaphor for variables a 'concept' smell? Dividing identifiers and
environments from variables in memory helps deflect that question. If variables
are a shortcut to values then we can focus on values and the tools that allow us to
reach them. Those tools are identifiers and environments, neither of which
contain variables.
