ALL ABOUT VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS

the world of variables

Most introductions to programming in a specific language begin with values and
their associated types. This book does not and I believe it's because of its
language independent approach. We skip a discussion of values and immediately
move to the world of variables.

What is a variable? Very succinctly it's a shortcut to a value and it saves
programmers from having to remember and retype values. But where do you begin to
try to understand the ins & outs of variables? I'm going to start with
assignment because all three fundamental concepts that underlie the word
'variable' are involved in assignment. *Assignment through the environment binds
an identifier to a variable in memory.* First, create a seperation to divide
variables in memory from identifiers and environments. The variable in memory
remains invisible to the programmer while the identifiers and environments
become the programmer's tools to interact with the variables in the store.

Is using the container metaphor for variables a 'concept' smell? Dividng
identifiers and environments from variables in memory helps deflect that
question. If variables are a shortcut to values then we can focus on values and
the tools that allow us to reach them. Those tools are identifiers and
environments, neither of which 'contain' variables.
